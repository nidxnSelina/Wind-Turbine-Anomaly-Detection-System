Wind Turbine Anomaly & Threshold Detection

A small, production-leaning toolkit for anomaly detection on wind-turbine (or similar time-series) data.
It currently provides:

AnomalyForecastModel — a supervised, classical ML pipeline (RandomForest) with scaling and class-imbalance handling.

ThresholdDetectionModel — a lightweight, training-free detector using simple numeric thresholds.
